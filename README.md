## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to document my homelab.

## Hardware

For the moment, my homelab is very basic.
It consists of two servers connected to my home network.

### Servers

My 2 servers are identical.
They are [Miniforum MS-01](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ms-01)
and have the following specs :
